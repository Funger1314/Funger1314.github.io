    <h3>First post</h3>
    <p>
        This week, I created my first personal website for the LIS 351 course.  
        At the beginning, I knew very little about HTML and CSS, but as I started building the pages, I learned how to structure content, create navigation links, and apply a consistent color palette.  
        I found it interesting how design and usability work together to make a website both beautiful and easy to use.  
        Through this project, I also realized that accessibility is not only a technical issue but a moral responsibility—everyone should be able to enjoy digital content equally.  
        I’m proud that my website reflects both creativity and structure, and I look forward to improving it in the future.
